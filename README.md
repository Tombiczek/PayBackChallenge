# PayBack Coding Challenge

## WorldOfPAYBACK App

### Notes:
- I completed the application to the best of my understanding of the requirements.
- Since I was unfamiliar with Apple's Network Framework, I incorporated existing code for the `NetworkStatus` class from the [Apple Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/733178). This allowed me to complete the application and provided me with the opportunity to learn about the Network Framework. Please note that I don't expect for this specific part of the project.
